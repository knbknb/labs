## Bayes Rule Exercises #1 (1 point possible)

A test for cystic fibrosis has an accuracy of 99%. Specifically, we mean that the probability of a positive test if you have the disease is 0.99 and this is also equal to the probability of testing negative if you don't have the disease:

`Prob(+|D) = 0.99, Prob(âˆ’|no D) = 0.99`

The cystic fibrosis rate in the general population is 1 in 3,900, `Prob(D) = 0.00025`

If we select a random person and they test positive, what is probability that they have cystic fibrosis Prob(D|+)? 
Hint: use Bayes Rule: `Pr(A|B) = Pr(B|A) * Pr(A) / Pr(B)`

```{r}

0.99 * 0.00025 /(0.99 * 0.00025 + 0.01 * 0.99975)

```
Rafa's solution:
```{r}

```
